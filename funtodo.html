<ul>
<li>Paper cup</li>
<li>Paints</li>
<li>Led bulbs</li>
<li>Some Wires</li>
</ul></div>
<div><p><b>Steps</b></p>
<ol>
<li>First thing you need to DIY paper cup lights, is a long rope of b-lights. If you don't know what B-lights are, they're small light bulbs stacked next to each other, that make the most beautiful soft light</li>
<li>Now you need to have a good amount of papers with prints on them, preferably with pastel colors. Take one of the paper cups and unfold it carefully. Trace the shape of the unfolded cup on the printed paper. Then cut the paper according to the tracing.</li>
<li>Now place the printed papers you just cut on the cups, and stick the ends together with a double face tape</li>
<li>With a small sharp cutter, make and X-shaped slit at the bottom of the cup. So you can drop the small light bulbs inside the cups. This way, you'll secure the cup from falling off when the rope is hanged</li>
<li>Now that you have your DIY paper cup lights ready, just decorate your room, or even terrace and enjoy the ambiance</li>

<h3><u> 3.T-shirt Bag </u> </h3><br><br><br>

<div><p><b> Waste Required</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Old T-shirt</li>
<li>Scissor</li>
<li>Thread</li>
<li>Stiching Needle</li>

</ul></div>
<div><p><b>Steps</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Cut off the sleeves. To make the cuts even, fold the t-shirt in half and cut both sleeves at the same time. Cut the fabric just past the seam where the sleeves are sewn to the body of the shirt.</li>
<li>Take your scissors and free hand cut off the collar of the shirt. It is recommended to cut a slightly oval shape as opposed to a round one. Make sure the back and front of the shirt line up and are cut to the same distance. This step is where the straps of the tote bag are finished. </li>
<li>Turn the shirt inside out. Decide how deep you want your bag to be and line up your tape so the bottom part is where the bag will end. Anything under the tape line will be used to close the bottom of the bag. </li>
<li>Start by cutting the left and right side of the shirt from the bottom up to the tape line, separating the top half from the bottom half of the shirt. Next, use your scissors to cut fringe on the bottom of the bag. Cut both the back and the front layers of the shirt together so they line up. Cut the slits from the bottom of the shirt to the tape line and make them about ½ inch apart.</li>
<li>Take the first pair of fringe and tie it into a knot. Then tie two more pairs. Grab one of the strands from 2 and tie it to one of the strands from 1. Next take the other strand from 2 and tie it to one of the strands from 3. Tie another pair of fringe next to 3 and then take the remaining strand from 3 and tie it to your new knot. Continue to do this for the whole bag. The purpose of tying the two strands of fringe together like this is to close the gap between fringe pairs.</li>
<li>Once all the fringe is tied, remove your tape and turn your bag inside out. Finish the bag by tying knots at the tops of the handles or tie some of the scrap fabric on as embellishments. If you want the fringe to be part of your bag, skip the part where you turn the t-shirt inside out.</li>

<li>Glass Or plastic bottle</li>
<li>Scissor</li>
<li>Glue</li>
<li>Paints</li>
<li>Wool Thread</li>
<li>Paper</li>

</ul></div>
<div><p><b>Steps</b></p>
<ol>
<li> Choose cool colors to cover your little bottles</li>
<li>Use glue or fevicol to cover the glass bottle vase </li>
<li> Start wrapping the wool yarn simply. Yarn just tight so that the glue attaches the woolen yarn to the glass. When you want to put another color, just cut the thread and paste the remaining part into the bottle. Press with your fingers so that the woolen thread is well glued to the glass bottle. </li>
<li>Go to the confection with the other wire, rolling it in the same way, following the same path in which the other wire stopped. Again, stop when you find it necessary, according to how many strands of wool you have and how you idealized your decorated bottle</li>
<li>Follow this pace until filling the entire bottle or as far as you see fit.</li>

<h3><u> 5.Teddy From Socks</u> </h3><br><br><br>

	box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px red;

<div><p><b> Waste Required</b></p>
<ul>
<li>2 Pair of Sock </li>
<li>Ribbons</li>
<li>Glue</li>
<li>Cotton/Rice</li>
<li>Map Pins</li>
<li>Rubber Band</li>

</ul></div>
<div><p><b>Steps</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Cut the sock in two just below the heel by a few inches and set the half with the toe aside.Turn the sock inside out.</li>
<li>Tie the cute end of the sock closed very tightly with a piece of white thread.</li>
<li>Pull the sock through the middle of the roll of duct tape and roll the edges over so the sock opens like a funnel  </li>
<li>Fill your sock with rice. The more rice you add, the more bumpy your snowman will be so that it looks like packed snow. Remember not to over fill! You still need to be able to close it.</li>
<li>Before you close the top, stand the sock so the tied part is on the bottom and carefully shape a head by shaping and pinching the sock a few inches below the opening.</li>
<li>Tie the top of the sock closed with another piece of white thread, knitting it tightly.</li>
<li>Where you shaped the “neck” earlier to mark the size of your snowman’s head, tie another thread. Pull as tightly as your rice will allow and knot the thread so the rice doesn’t slip through and make your snowman’s head shrink.</li>
<li>Cut some scrap fabric and tie it around your snowman’s neck as a scarf.</li>
<li>Fold the cut edge of your sock’s toe (or the toe of another coloured or patterned sock) upward a few times like a hat cuff.</li>
<li>Place the folded sock toe on your snowman’s head like a little toque.</li>
<li>Glue buttons down the front of your snowman’s tummy for some cute detail.</li>
<li>Give your snowman a face using markers, fabric paint, or sewing pins with coloured ends!</li>
